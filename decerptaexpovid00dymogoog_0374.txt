orcus Scorpios, where the Scorpion in a circular direction
extends his claws over two signs (11. 195).

Scylla, ω, a daughter oi l’hdrcus, according to nrme;of'1'y·
phon, according to others; and ol* Hecate, according to
Homer; buthe does not mention her father. Circe, either
from jealousy, because Scylla was a greater favourite with
Glaucus than herself, or, atahe request of that deity, turned
her into 'a sea monster of the most hideous form. Some say
that she retained ber original form and beauty down to the
waist; hut others assert, that she had six heads, es many
throats, and instead ol hands, two claws. Homer states she
had twelre feet, and in the mouth ol' each ol her six heuds
were triple rows of teetb. All agree that her middle was en-
compaesed by dogs, which never ceased barking. With the
exception of Homer, the ancient poets represent her body ter-
minating in ahuge and hideousfish withalorked tall. Her
residence was in a cave of the same name in Fretum Siculum,
the Strui psMcnz‘no, on·the Italian side, supposed to bava
been nearly opposite to charybdis, on the coastol' Sicily. This
liction probably originated in the south οἲ Italy being raraged
by Phoenicians, whose ship bad on the prow the lileness of a
monstrans lemale; and the dreadful noise of the waves in a
tempest rushing into the cavities, would in alter ages give
additional support to the suble. Another explanation of thas
mhlthtlttlllhlifit⁹lfl⁰iiiiltss²l⁰lln nng of
Megilra, who coneeired a violent passion for Minos king of
creto, Caudio, when he wns besieging her father's capital.
To ensure the fall of the city, an ‚ in consequence ol that
erent, the affection of her lover, she cut off from her father’s
head, whilst asleep‚ a bair of a purple colone, on which his
good fortune depended, end presented ic to him. Minos
soon aster carried the place, but punished the perfidy oi
Scylla, hy ordering herto be thrown into the sea She was
changed, according to some, into a fieb, and, according to
others, into a larls or a hawlc. virgil hasbeen censured for con·
founding the storias of Scylla, daughter ol Nisus with that ol
