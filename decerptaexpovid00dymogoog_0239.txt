*the Greeks (Sat 10. 174). The encients rechoned that tha
cimumierence ol this mountain was about 130 miles, that it pro·
jected its shadow ts miles, and that the sun was seen on its top
two or three hours sooner thau at the bottom. 'lhese asser-
tions greatly exceed the truth. Its height cannot be estimated
at more than 4560 feet ; of course, the sun will not be risible
at its summit above six or seren minutes before he can be seen
nt the foot of it, oron the plain. From the twenty monaster·
ies which nre upon it, containing four thousand monks, it has de·
rived the modern name Monte Sancto, i. e. the sacred mountain.
