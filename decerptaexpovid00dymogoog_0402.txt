Tonn1n‚two Temnum, end two Furore, or, Fsorsw. The
first, which is in the middle, has its neme from being very hot.
'l'he ancients erroneously supposed that it could not be inhabit-
od from the violence os its hest.

Quorum qoae medio est, non ert habitabilis aertu.

It extends srorn the Equotor on each side to the Tropics, s
distance of 253⁰, 28'. consequently the Tosnrn Zone is 3262
miles in hreadth. Here the sun is vertical twice o year, tho
days and nights nearly equal, and the twilight very short. The
two Trnrrnrrs Zones are situated on each side of the Torrt'd
Zone, which Ovid hos occurotely and neotly described,

Temperiemque dedit mitid coorsrr'goreflommd.

They lie between the Tropies ond the Polar Circhr, viz. he-
tween 93⁰, 282 end 66⁰, 522 so thet each is 8423 miles broad.
To the inhabitants ol the Norrnern Temperare Zone, the sun
is always south atnoon end to those in the Seuthem Temperare
Zone, he is olweys north at chattime. In both, the twilidght

increases, and the dsy varies in length in proportion to the is· Α
tonce from the Equotor. The two Fsozsn Zonrs lie beyond
the Temperare, round the poles, at which there is only one doy
ond one night in the year. The ideo which the encicntsform·
ed respecting them, was not much rnore correct than thot
which they conceived respecting the Torrr‘l Zone. They sup·
posed these zoner were perpetually covered with enow, Nio
tegit alto door (1. 50), ond therefore uninhalritable. But mo-
dern discoveries have proved the fellacy of that opinion. It
must. however, be aclcnowledged, thet from the long absence
of the sun, ond from the severity of the cold. added to the ster·
ility ol these countries lying within the Northern, or, Arche,
Polar circle, they ore rendered a very dreery and uncomsorr-
oble place of residence. No lond hos yet been discovered
within the Southern. or, Antarotic, Poler circlo
