it Era-atico Delon, and adds tum caim lenis inrhfn nabot. 'I'he
etymology of the name gives a preference to the former opin-
ion, which is supported by Pliny and Aristotle. Of Delos,
the ancient names were Ortygia, cynthia, cynaethns, thla,
Astdrla and chlamydis. Ortygia has been referred to quails
(serapte, Greek) having been first seen in that island ς Cy'nthio
and cynaethon to hunting, (awo ra novor, et arbo), from the ar·
dour of the dogs of chase; Legra, nothe great number of hares

Chldnryldio to the upper robe of the natives. lt was also cal·
led Pyrpus, fromfire having been first found there. Pliny
adds that it is the only island which cannot be shaken by earth·
quales. From this island Apollo is called Delius (Ι. 454),
