red to any other, occur in the Metamorphoses. From the
praise ul originality must he excepted the conclusion cf that
poem, which, if genuine, certainly detracta from tlte merit
of Ovid. It is a very close, and not a very happy, imitation
of Horace, III. Od. 80. To charge him with vanity, cf
which the sarna poetv had given such a striking erample,
might be deemed harsh cr unjust. Propertius, Lucan, and
other Latin poets have lilaewise indulged in the pleasing
anticipation of immortality. Still. servility has no claim to
applause, nor vanity to esteem. Few will be disposed to
rnaintain, that the conclusion is not one of the worst passages
os the whole poem; seeble, languid, and prosaic. It can
scarcely bedenied, that 0vid, in this instance, did violence
to his genius, by condescending to horrow ideas and language,
recommended neither by novelty nor dignity, when his own
mind would readily have furnished what was appropriate, lor-
cihle, and original.
