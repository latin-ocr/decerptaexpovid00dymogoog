That the mythology ol the Greeks, which the Romans a·
dopted with little variation or addition, is of eastern origin has
been generally admitted. Most of the Grecian states seem to
have been peopled froin Phoenicia and Egypt, aad these emi·
granta would carry into their new settlements the customs aad
the worship ol their ancestors. In aiter ages, their sables and
allegorias would naturally assume something oi‘ the cast aad
mode of thinking peculiar to that state of society3 aad the em·
bellishmentsol succeeding poets, who adopted thern to erist·
ing and local circumstances, would gradually disiigure, and, at
last totally destroy‚ every traca of Oriental descent. To the

· strong propensity ol the Asiatic nations, particularly those in
the southern regions, to personilication, or the ascribing the
qualities of a person to inanimate objects; to the hleroglyplric
waiting ol the Egyptians and some other nations3 and to thar
veneration of ancestry‚ may be referred many ol the sables and
allegorias ottae Greeks aad Romans. These fictious gave risa
to several of their deities: some, perhaps the greater number,
os their gods, wem mortals, who received divine honours after
their death, originatiug in tha gratitude of their countrymen,
for the benefits they had conserrcd ou society, either by the
discovery of the arts, or the improvement and just administra„

¹ tion of the laws. 'l'he truth of deification the Cretans not only
= maintained, but proved. by showing the tomb of Jupiter in
⁸ their island 3 aud this very circumstance gave rise to the saying

- of Epimenides, quoted by the apostle Paul in his epistle to
Titus, ‘⁴ The Cretans are always liars;’' because the other
Greeks wished to exalt their national religion by concealing
that fact, aud others of a similar kind .

But from whatever source or cause the mythology of Graece
and Rome at first sprung, it cannot he denied‚ that, as it ap·
pears in the writings ol these two nations, it is an immense

r accumulatiou of the most absurd and contradictory lables. Had
contradiction and absurdity been the only charges to which
mythology is exposed, tha system would have claimed s high·
