ed by a Greeian colony (959 B. C.). the walls of which are
stated to have been 1⁴2 miles in circumference. Dldnyslus,
king of stt-rna Sicily, carried it by sturm, but not before he
bad invested it botlr by land and sea. Pytlrligbras established
his school there, and is said, by his doctrine and example, to
have greatly relormed the dissolute manners of the inhabi-
tants, Crdtdnle'nae, arum. Auj. cretenensis, is, e.

cepidonnis, Cupid, the god of love. There were two oi this
name. One, the son oi Jupiter ond Vinus, who presided
overlawtul love; the other, theson of Erebus and Nor, who
delighted in impurity. Cupid is represented asa naked boy,
armed with a bow and quiver full of arrowS. To show his
power, he is, atone time, seen riding on a lion or a dolphin,
and, at another, breaking in pieces the thunderbolts oi Jhpl-
ter. His worship was nearly the sameas that of his mother
Venus.

carettum, i, n. corat, e substance produced under the sea,
which continues soit as long as it remains under water, bnt
becomes hard on being exposed to the air. Ovid considers
coral as a marine plant, which was at first petrihed by the
touch of Mbdhsa's head. 'l'he sea nymphe, he adds, spread
the seeds thus produced over the ocean, and propagnted the
plant almost every where. This is merely a poetic fiction.

. eoral was long considered n vegetable substance 3 but there
is now a strong probability, if not sn absolute certainty, that
it 'ns the productiori of a particular kind ol’ animal. Ol the
three varieties of Coral, red, white, and blaek, the last is sel·
domest found, oi course esteemed the most valuable.
