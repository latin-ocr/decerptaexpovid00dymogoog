of the scener'y of the lario has been yet laid before the public.
Notis this wonderful; for, upwards of 1700 years ago, no per.
aon pretendcd to know the site of ancient Troy. Of lata,
chiefly since chevalier fancied that he had discovered the ruine

of that city, much has been written on this interesting subject.
·Alrnost every traveller, who has, for these twenty years past, '
visited the eastern shore of the Archipelugo and the Darden·
elles, has advanced a new theory ς and. though his own may have
failed ιο produce convIction, has had the merit of proving, that
those of his predecessore were erroneous, and at varianae with
the truth of geography aad history, or with the iliad. or with
both. Of the two rivers, Slmbia and Scimtmder, which occur
so frequently in the poems of Homer, it is but justice to both
to state, that they have been no bar to any conjecture or hypo-
thesis. Since Chevalier’s publication appeared, these streame
have shown a ductility truly surprising, have changed from
right to left, or from left to right, run into each other on either
bank. of course flowed in different directions, or creeped along

Homer's two promontories were Sigeum and Rhaetlum, Agal-
memnon’s skill iu encampment could not claim high commen-
vlation; since the extremities of the Grecian camp would, in
that case, have been three'miles distant with the additional
disadvantage of being separated in the middle by a considerable
river and morass, almost it not wholly, impassable. Every
slight inequality in the surface of the adjoining plain hasbeen
imagined the romb of some ‘¹ mighty chief untimely stain?
and every stone. once used in abuilding, hasbeen supposed a
fragment of Troy. The site of that city itself‚ has been dis-
covered near thesea, on the plain, and so close to the foot
of Ida, that the rocks of this precipitous range of mountaina
formed its northern wall. According to the last supposition‚
Troy must have stood 10 miles from the coast, and conse· ⁴
quently 10 miles from the Grecian camp. Nay, further, the
ruins of the city, Troy, which Homer seems to place on
a plain, ltave travelled up tlte hill! nn assumption which
