ciiba. His father ordered him ιο be put ιο death at hia
birth, in consequence of his mother having, during her preg.
nancy, dreamed that she was delivered of a lire-brand which
reduced the city to ashes3 and the Augure interpreting
the dream to‘porteud that the child, then unbem, would oc·
oasion the destruction of Troy. The persons appointed to this
cruel office, contente-d themselves with exposing Pllris on mount
ida, the highest range of which was anciently called Garghrus,
Koedoghy, or hhzrlaghy, where he was brought up by the
shepherds. On account of his extraordinary strength and
courage in defending the llocks from ravenous beasts, and re·
pelling the attacks of robbers. he was called Alexander, ι’. e,
the strong man. Here he passed the early part of his life.
and, whilst engaged intending his flock, gave judgqqent iu
the appeal of the three goddesses, Venus, June, end nerra,
who contended' for tlre golden epple, hence Ov'ui calls him
Idaeusjude'a. ⁴ See Peleus (2 syl). Each endeavoured ιο bribe
him to ber interest. Juno promised him a kingdom, Miner

the world for his wife. Upon the mind of the noble shepherd,
the promise of Vinus made the deepest impression, and he
adjudged the golden appla to her. The decision of Paris, by
slighting the beauty of the other two goddesses, provoked
their wrath against the empire and his nation, was the cause
of the Trojan war, and all the train of evils and calamities tt
which that memorahle siege gave birth. His father, at a fu-

· ture period received him at his'court. and treated him as his
son. After spending some time in his native city among the

' Trojan princes, he set out for the court of ntentans, king of
spera. Mistra, witha view to carry otf his wife Heldua, the
most beautiful woman in the world, as the reward of the
judgment which he had pronounced in favour of Venus. The
young Trojan met witha most welcomc reception at the
Spartan court; buthe abused the laws of hospitality, by pre·
vailing on the queen to elope with him. Though demanded
back by all the princes who had aworn ιο protect her, and
threatened with the vengeance of the combined forces of
Graece, be resolutely persisted in refusing their request. His

’ father is said, on account of Ajax carrying off his sister He·
sicine, to have encouraged himin hisobstinacy and guilt. In
consequence of this denial, tha Greeks immediately commea)-
ced hostilities, which ended in the total destruction oi use ewa
