Drihvium, i, a. a flood or deiuge. That so remarkable an erant
as that of the universal deiuge should hare been transmittedior
many ages by oral tradition so as to be generally known,
ought rather tocommand belief, than excite surprise. Hense,
we find some account of that supernatural occurrence in tae
history of almost all nations who hare had any knowledge oi
letters, or who have attained to eminente either by extent oi
power, or progress in civilisation. It isos importante tore·
mark, that the wickedness of men has been uniformly tha

translations from the Sanscrit have, it may be almost affirmed,

of an inspired penman can with propriety be said to admit oi
additional confirmation.
