be estimated at 4000 feet. ‘⁶ The forms ol Ossa, Kisscua
and Pehon, seen from the south, explain well that part of
the ancient fahle of the war of the Giants against the gods,
which supposes the former mountain to bave been placed
on the latter. Ossa has a steeply conical form, terminatIng
in a point. Pelion, on the other hand, exhibite a broad and
less abrupt outline: when the spectator stands to the south
of this maumam, two summits are seen at a considerable dis-
tance hom each orben-a concavity between them, buteo
slightas almost to give the effect of a table-mountain, upon
which fiction might readily suppose that another bill like Ossa
should recline” Fabulous history made Ossa the abode ol
the Centaure. Peneus, the Salaminia, which waters the
beautiful vale of Tempe, Lycos-tomos. flows through a deep
ravine between Olympus and Ossa, Karana. These two cele-
brated heigbts, with Pelion, forming part of the same range
of monnulus, bound Tempe ua the east. See next article.

Ovidius Naso (Publius), Pirblli ovrdri Nasonis, wasa native
of Srilmo, Sulmone, sulmonensis), a town of the Peligni,
about 90 miles E. irom Rome, and 82 from the Gulf ‘ff
Venice. His birth is referred to the memorable year, in
which the consuls, Hirtius and Pansa, were killed at Mutina,
Madian, q. u. Tibullus, whose merite as an Elegiae poet are
highly estimated, was born on the same day. Ovid’s parents
were oi' Equestrian rank, in possession of a good estate, to
which he was indebted for an excellent education. His uu-
common progress in his studies was a natural consequence of
great application‚ united with great genius. 'lhat lerity ol'
disposition, not to use stronger language‚ which disgracerl his
riper years, did not intersere with his literary pursuits. At
what period he lirst attempted to write verses, we have no
certain information. Like Pope and Cowley, he seems to
have lisped in numbers. Warmth ol affection and benevo-
lence of beart, added to elegance of manners and brilliaucy
of wit, rendered him a most agreeable compauion. His con-
versatIon was suited to all descriptious of men, cheerlul, grave,
lar, or rigid‚ according to the toste ol those around him, or
the train ol' thought prevalent in his own mind. “aas istaes
