Nilus, i, m. the Nile, a large river of Africa, which, taking its
rise in Ahyeriuio, posses through Abec, Nuhio, and Egypt,
and disemhogues itself into the Mediterraneum anciently hy
seven, now hy two, mouths, in lat 310 27¹. Some 01 the
writers 01 antiquity reckoned the number 01 the mouths of
this noble river to be not fewer than elenen, but in ge-
neral they were accounted seven. The two which remeia,
and by which the Nile poure it waters into the Mediterra-
ueon, are Ostium canopicum, the Rosettn brooch, on the W.
and Ostium phiemetheum, u. Phatnitlcum, the Domietc
branch, on the E. These two, with the Mediterraneum
form the Delta 01 Egypt. This celebrated river begins to
overflow its banhs about the end 01 May or beginning 01
June, end the inundation continues until September, aad
sometimes October. The periodical rains, which annually
commoneo at the time the sun is vertical in Abyssinio, occa·
sion the overllowing 01 this river. lt generally risos sixteen
cubits. The hippopothmus and crocodile, both amphibious
animale, inhahit the banks 01 the Nile. The source 01 this
river was a subject 01 inquiry among the ancients, and also
among the moderas, until Bruce (01 Kinnaird, Stirlingshire)
undertook his journey to ascertain the place where the Nae
takes its rise, andis now genernlly allowed to have succeed-
ed. From its fletness, difference 01 soil from the adjacent
country, and projecting so l'ar beyond the line 01 the coast,
it is prohohle the Delta was formed hythe alluvione of thia
grand river. It has greatly increased both in hreadrh and
length In the time 01 Moeris, 500 years before the Tro-
jan war, the Nile rising eight cubita inundated ir. Bur

The Delta is exeeedingly fertile, and the only part 01 Egypt
