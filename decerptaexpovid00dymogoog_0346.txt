shipped in the inmost part olths house, called from them Pe·
netralta, um, ra. Except the Penates Publici, brought by
AEneas from Troy, to which divine honours were performed in
the Capitol, the worship of this class of gods was contined to
the most secret part of the house, aresttiction to which tha
ademtion of the Liras, with whom they are osten confoun-
ded, was not subject. The religious ritcs of the latter might
ba celebrated in the house, in the street, in the flelds, in the
camp, or at sea.

Peneus, u. os, i, rn. the Salampn‘a, a river of Thessaly, which has
its source in mount Pindus, Melaena, watars tha beautiful vale
of Tempe, choatlimaa, runs in a deep and narrow ravine be·
tween Olimpus and Ossa for nearlyiive milas, and, afterwards,
poure its waters into Sinus Thermlllcus, the curs of Salonina.
In its course through the plain of Tempe, tha solempnia, re-
ceives five streams, some of which are considerable. The
channel of this river, whilst it traversas the plain, is, in soma
places, nearly a quarter of a mile wide3 but itis only ia
winter, that ita waters are of that breadth. Hera and there
it forms a few small islanda which, like its banlra, are coveren
with wood, chiefly pines. The Greek, and particularly tht
Latin poeta, sang the laurela which shaded this beautiful stream
'ihc Latius lrnew little ol the geography of Graeca, and the
laurei is more a favourita with the Poeta than tha pina, which
may perhaps account for the mistake. On leaving tha vale,
the Salamprria covers itawhole chanml in its passage through
the guli between Olimpus and Ossa, while melas, almost per-
pandiculan‘ contina it tn a space, in some places not axceedmg
two hundred fect. Alongthia deep and narrow out-let, which
does not materially differ from a straight lina, Peneus, the

So large a river as 'the Salnmpria haring forced a passage
for itself between two mountains of so great height aa olympus,
